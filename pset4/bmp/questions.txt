1.  What is stdint.h
    - header file that allows provides a set of typedefs 
        that give exact-width integer types, along with macrso that the define min and max values. 
        
2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    - unisgned integers which will allow for safe use across machines that interpret them as different bits. 
    
3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    - BYTE = 1 byte
    - DWORD = 4 bytes
    - Long = 4 bytes
    - Word = 2 bytes
    
4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    - ASCII - BM 
    - Hex - 0x424d

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize
    - bfSize is total number of bytes in the file
    - biSize is number of bytes in the header
    
6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative
    - If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
    
7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    - biBitCount
    
8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    - If it can't find the file inptr or outptr
    
9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    - It specifies the number of elements to read but we only have 1 struct thus it takes 1.
    
10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3
    - The padding would be 3 because 3 pixels * 3bytes per pixel  = 9*3padding = 12 which is a multiple of 4
    
11. What does fseek do?
    - moves to the specified location in the file.
    
12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    - an integer constant that specifies how the offset should be interpreted
