0.  What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
    - is an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.

1.  According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
    - returns resource usage measures for who, which can be one of the following: 
     RUSAGE_SELF
              Return resource usage statistics for the calling process,
              which is the sum of resources used by all threads in the
              process.
    RUSAGE_CHILDREN
              Return resource usage statistics for all children of the
              calling process that have terminated and been waited for.
              These statistics will include the resources used by
              grandchildren, and further removed descendants, if all of the
              intervening descendants waited on their terminated children.
    RUSAGE_THREAD (since Linux 2.6.26)
              Return resource usage statistics for the calling thread.  The
              _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro must be defined (before
              including any header file) in order to obtain the definition
              of this constant from <sys/resource.h>.
              
2.  Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
    
    struct rusage {
               struct timeval ru_utime; /* user CPU time used */
               struct timeval ru_stime; /* system CPU time used */
               long   ru_maxrss;        /* maximum resident set size */
               long   ru_ixrss;         /* integral shared memory size */
               long   ru_idrss;         /* integral unshared data size */
               long   ru_isrss;         /* integral unshared stack size */
               long   ru_minflt;        /* page reclaims (soft page faults) */
               long   ru_majflt;        /* page faults (hard page faults) */
               long   ru_nswap;         /* swaps */
               long   ru_inblock;       /* block input operations */
               long   ru_oublock;       /* block output operations */
               long   ru_msgsnd;        /* IPC messages sent */
               long   ru_msgrcv;        /* IPC messages received */
               long   ru_nsignals;      /* signals received */
               long   ru_nvcsw;         /* voluntary context switches */
               long   ru_nivcsw;        /* involuntary context switches */
           };
           
3.  Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
    - it expects a pointer, which is more efficient than a value
    
4.  Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
    - first main determines the variables (index, misspellings, words) and an array to prepare spell check.
    Then it spell checks each word using fgetc() until the end of the file. fgetc() gets each character of the word and puts it in an array.
    Then checks if the characters are in alphabetical order and stores in the array word. If the word is too long or numbers are present, the word is skipped over.
    After all characters are checked the counter is update. check() returns true if word is in dictionary else false. if check() is false then misspelled stores the word. Then the next word is checked.

5.  Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
    - fgetc() checks if the character is a valid letter whereas scanf() doesn't.
    
6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    - The paramaters are pointers, which do not change the value they are pointing to, rather they just read the value.
